This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("BetaBit")
library("BetaBit")
install.packages("dplyr")
library("dplyr")
proton()
emp <- employees
john = filter(emp, name == "John", surname =="Insecure")
proton(action = "login", login="johnins")

Pass <-top1000passwords
for (i in 1:1000){proton(action = "login", login="johnins", password=Pass[i])}

log<-logs
slap = filter (log, login=="slap")
host <- unique(slap["host"])
proton(action = "server", host="194.29.178.16")

strings <- bash_history
for(i in 1:19913){}

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
